1. The first problem I found with the code was that it was quite repetitive. For example, the main algorithm constantly checks each surrounding square on every action performed for possible end games and disables the buttons on the board. This section of code gets called multiple times and should be written as a separate function.
2. The general commenting is subpar and doesn’t help others understand it well. The main algorithm has only a couple commented lines to explain what is happening, and not much is said at that. To help others understand the code, I can add more extensive comments.
3. The model and view components are highly comparable. These components should interact with each other but they are almost the same aspect of the implementation (JButton). To fix this a copy of the value of the text set to the JButton should be assigned to an array of tuples where the index represents the number of the JButton and the tuple entries are first, a boolean showing whether the button is enabled or not and second a letter value copy of that in the view.
4. The implementation is highly java dependent. For an extensible deployment of the product, it would make sense to use components that adhere to other languages as well. The removal of the GUI would make the code more extensible.
